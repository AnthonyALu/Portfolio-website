                <p> 
                    While searching for some inspiration to design my home page, I came across a typing animation on my friend's website that caught my attention. 
                    Of course, I asked him how he did it but to my despair he told me that he did it in Javascript, which I know nothing of. 
                    Nevertheless, I was determined to create it and so I tried to find a way to recreate it using only CSS.
                    Unfortunately, expectations did not quite meet reality.

                <br><br>
                <h3>First Attempt:</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a container to hold the text and I figured that one way I could change the content of my title is by using the content function in CSS.
                    It looked like it worked perfectly, changing the text by using keyframes.
                    My only concern was that changing the keyframes would be quite time consuming in the future but I was quite pleased with the results.
                    However, as I tried to add the responsive design constraints, I found that I wasn't able to resize the text.
                    Due to my limited knowledge I wasn't able to come up with a solution to this issue, but I wasn't ready to give up yet. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Second Attempt:</h3>
                <p>I decided that I would give it one last shot. 
                    This time I thought to try and switch between texts by preparing the text and adjusting the size of them to make them 'invisible' in my keyframes.
                    It did seem a bit ambitious and seemed to involved a lot of work, but clearly I was obsessed with this animation.
                    After much toil, I tested my code and once again to my disappointment, it was almost perfect. 
                    Though most of the time it worked fine, sometimes it would lag and you would be able to see flashes of the text that did not get hidden in time.

                <p>Nice try, but I think I will learn Javascript before I attempt this one again...</p>
